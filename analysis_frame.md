# Analysis Frame

## customizable
There should be a grid that can be arranged how the user likes it
showing the appropriate date(s) by sphere(s)/project(s)/break(s)
once set up it stays that way.
there is a button to reset it back to default
able to hide or drag smaller the break/idle data

### standard date filters
- by date
- by date range
- by sessions
- all time
- last two weeks
- last 14 days
- last 7 days
- last business week
- this business week

#### default date filters showing
    be able to select a multiple of date windows to show
    for example always show active period by project
        1. all time
        2. last two weeks
        3. this week


### spheres 
- show all byt date filters
- show varying amount of projects/breaks


### important distinctions
    active period and idle/break periods
    need to see those at the same time
    but customizable to hide either

## design thoughts - updated
    three cards across the top
    filter at the top spheres and projects 
    shows active and break for duration
    if selected button the it populates the timeline with that date range if sphere>project
    download csv button at the top
